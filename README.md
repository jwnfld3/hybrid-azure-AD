# Hybrid Azure AD Join for Windows Server 2022

## Overview
This repository contains a lab that demonstrates how to connect a Windows Server 2022 to Azure AD via **Hybrid Azure AD Join**. This setup allows Windows Server devices to be both **domain-joined** (on-premises) and **Azure AD-joined** (cloud), providing centralized management and enhanced security. Hybrid Azure AD Join enables devices to authenticate across both environments seamlessly.

## Lab Requirements

- **Azure AD**: A cloud-based identity and access management service that enables secure authentication and device management for cloud-based resources.
- **Hybrid Azure AD Join**: A configuration that allows devices to be joined to both on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD, enabling seamless management and authentication across both environments.
- **Windows Server 2022**: The operating system on which the Hybrid Azure AD Join configuration will be performed.
- **Administrator Access**: Required to perform actions on the server and configure hybrid Azure AD join settings.
- **Azure AD Connect**: A tool that synchronizes on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD and is required for Hybrid Azure AD Join configuration.
- **Internet Access**: Required to ensure the server can communicate with Azure AD endpoints.

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Install and Configure Azure AD Connect

**Azure AD Connect** is a Microsoft tool that integrates on-premises directories (like Active Directory Domain Services) with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). It enables a hybrid identity by synchronizing identity data between on-premises environments and Azure, allowing users to use the same credentials for both cloud and on-premises resources.

---

### Key Functions:
- **Directory Synchronization**: Syncs users, groups, passwords, and other directory objects from on-premises AD to Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to authenticate once and access both on-premises and cloud resources without re-entering credentials.
- **Password Hash Sync (PHS)**: Enables cloud authentication by syncing password hashes to Azure.
- **Pass-through Authentication (PTA)**: Validates passwords directly against the on-premises Active Directory in real time.
- **Federation Integration**: Supports federation with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) for more advanced scenarios.

---

### Why It Matters:
Azure AD Connect is essential for organizations with a hybrid cloud infrastructure, as it:
- Maintains consistent user identities across environments.
- Simplifies user access and administration.
- Enables secure access to Microsoft 365, Azure, and other cloud applications.

5. Confirm that **Azure AD Connect** is properly set up and can sync with both on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD.

### Step 2: Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join in Azure AD Connect

**Hybrid Azure AD Join** is a configuration that allows Windows devices to be joined to both the on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). This setup enables unified device management and identity, bridging on-premises infrastructure with the cloud.

When devices are **Hybrid Azure AD Joined**, they are registered with Microsoft Entra ID while still being managed by Group Policy and other on-premises tools. This provides a path for organizations to move toward cloud-based management gradually.

---

### What Does "Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join in Azure AD Connect" Mean?

This process involves enabling and configuring the **device registration** settings in **Azure AD Connect** to ensure that domain-joined Windows devices automatically register with Microsoft Entra ID.

---

### Why It Matters:
- Enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)** from domain-joined devices to Azure and Microsoft 365 services.
- Allows for a **gradual transition** from on-premises to cloud-based device management using tools like Microsoft Intune.
- Supports **Conditional Access** policies and **Multi-Factor Authentication** for increased security.

---

### How It Works:
1. **Enable Device Writeback (optional)** â€“ Allows Entra-joined devices to be written back to the on-prem AD.
2. **Configure Azure AD Connect**:
   - Launch the **Azure AD Connect wizard**.
   - Choose **Configure device options**.
   - Select **Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join**.
   - Choose the appropriate **Windows version (10 or newer)**.
   - Specify the **on-premises forest** and allow the wizard to verify connectivity.
3. **Group Policy Configuration**:
   - Configure **Automatic Device Registration** using Group Policy on client devices.

Once this is set up, domain-joined devices that meet the criteria will automatically register with Microsoft Entra ID the next time they restart or check in with AD.

---

1. Open **Azure AD Connect** and go to **Configure**.

3. Follow the instructions to configure synchronization for devices in your on-premises AD.
4. Complete the setup, and allow Azure AD Connect to begin synchronizing devices.

### Step 3: Test Synchronization:

1. Initiate a manual sync by clicking on the "Run" button under Sync Status or use PowerShell to trigger a synchronization (e.g., Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta).
2. Monitor the sync process to ensure it completes without errors.

### Step 4: Verify Synchronization in Azure AD:

1. Log in to the Azure AD portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory > Users to confirm that user objects from your on-premises AD have been successfully synchronized.
